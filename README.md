# CF-Solutions
A place for **me** to store my solutions for cf contests. This repo has been created for my own learning purpose, and to drive me
keep it complete by upsolving as many as contests i participate in.

## How can you help/contribute? 
If you see any contest, that doesn't have all the solutions, it's probably because i haven't upsolved all the problems of that contest.
If you understand the solution of such a problem thoroughly, explain it in the following manner:
  - Clone the repo
  - Create an appropriate cpp file in the appropriate folder (name of file should be alphabet representing sequence of problem in that contest).
  - Write your explanation for the problem in commented structure at the start of the file. For eg:
      /* Logic ...... */
  - Create a PR 
  
  <b>NOTE:</b> *You are not supposed to write the code. Just an explanation in your own words would suffice.*
